# VectorC
Safe vector in C for any type, but because of safety little slow ~0-20% than std::vector from C++. Support C89 and latest.
Welcome to Vector in C. To use it, please see the commands in the macros section in the header vector.h, as well as the sample code in the main.c section.
Anyone knows how to optimize, please write in a comment.
You can compare with vector in C++. It might be interesting to see the difference.
Well, thanks for visiting my code :)
