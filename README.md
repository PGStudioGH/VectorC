# VectorC
Safe vector in C for any type, but because of safety little slow ~0-20% than std::vector from C++. Support C89 and latest.
Welcome to Vector in C. To use it, please see the commands in the macros section in the header vector.h, as well as the sample code in the main.c section.
Anyone knows how to optimize, please write in a comment.
You can compare with vector in C++. It might be interesting to see the difference.

However, I recommend you use VectorC.h for own project in C. Because there is a template and convenient use here. A bit like OOP. Look at an example from file example.c.
